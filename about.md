I work in the publishing industry. My experience covers corporate and digital strategy, commercial and business development, operations and marketing. I hold an MBA (with distinction) from [Cass Business School](http://www.cass.city.ac.uk/mba), where I researched my dissertation on corporate venture capital and the interaction between established businesses and startups. Practical experience in this area includes [acting as an advisor to the REACT Creative Economy Hub](http://www.react-hub.org.uk/about-us) and [as a startup mentor for R/GA Ventures](https://www.rgaiot.com/). I am an alumnus of [the Yale Publishing Course](http://som.yale.edu/programs/executive-education/for-individuals/yale-publishing-course) and [a Liveryman of the Stationers Company](https://stationers.org/).

[I publish a weekly email newsletter which covers media, innovation, venturing and strategy. You can find out more and sign up here](www.georgewalkley.com/newsletter).

[I am an experienced and highly acclaimed speaker at events around the world: my speaking page has information on forthcoming engagements and how to contact me](www.georgewalkley.com/speaking).
