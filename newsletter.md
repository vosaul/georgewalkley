I publish a weekly email newsletter on media, innovation, venturing and strategy. [You can subscribe to it here](http://georgewalkley.us15.list-manage2.com/subscribe?u=808fdaa370fd1e21e55efda7d&amp;id=1dd0743f99). Readers describe it as:
* "[A]Â must read weekly summary of important and interesting updates... You need this in your life - sign up."
* "Clear, concise, curated and clever."
* "Unlike so many newsletters, filled with much more signal than noise."
* "Interesting, eclectic and thought-provoking."
* "It certainly makes me better at what I do and what I want to do next."
