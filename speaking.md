I am a regular speaker at conferences and events around the world, speaking on publishing, media, digital strategy, innovation and organisational change. My experience includes keynote presentations, roundtables and panel discussions, either as participant or moderator. The feedback I've received from hosts and audience members highlights clarity, depth of research and excellence in delivery.
